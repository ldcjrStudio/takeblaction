            Take Blaction is a collective group invested in making lasting,
            positive and impactful change. We've created a collective working to
            define the term,{" "}
            <strong>
              Blact (verb): to act with the intent of benefitting Black Lives.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this collective is to compile resources for Black racial
            and social justice into one place so that anyone can easily access
            and navigate all of the databanks, resources, and links to black
            justice materials.
