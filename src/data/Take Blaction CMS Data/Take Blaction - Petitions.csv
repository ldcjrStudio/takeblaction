There is video footage of this cold blooded murder but, the father and son who murdered an innocent man are walking free because one of them used to be a cop.I want justice for Ahmaud Arbery, it sickens me that the men the killed Ahmaud are still walking free. If two black men pulled up next to a white jogger and shoot him dead they would most likely get the death sentence in Georgia. This is a hate crime. This is clear white prejudice and injustice working in America, and I will not stand for it and I hope you will not either. We don’t live in some third world country where people get killed in broad day light in the middle of a street with video evidence and nothing is done.This is unconstitutional, unjust, and unbelievable, I’m done sitting down, it’s time to make a change, it’s time we start caring about each other. It comes to a point where enough is enough.We can help the Arbery family by getting them the support they need, we need to raise awareness for them.#JusticeForAhmaudArbery </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5ee38bf3d6081e3e579ac98a_petitions_change.jpeg,change.org

This whole incident makes me sick. The power that comes with the PD is old news. It's 2020 and we still have racist police officers murdering innocent civilians. This is bull sh*t. I don't care if the officer were to be red, blue, yellow, black, or purple. The man murdered another human being for no reason. He was getting some sick satisfaction of crushing this man's neck. He sat there crushing his neck cutting off his air passages. The man started bleeding from his nose before going unconscious. The Police Department remained completely unphased by it. One officer checked his pulse after the man went unconscious. At this point the man was gone. He was murdered for what reason? This was no medical condition. And even If the man had any medical condition whatsoever he would still be alive today had this officer not spent over 15 minutes crushing his throat. The man was NOT fighting back at this point. Everything was under control. Yet the officer continued using excessive force. I ask the you [we] the people stand up to the Minneapolis Police Department. Both officers are to be charged with murder and to be sentenced to the highest possible amount of time in Federal prison. Enough is enough!!! No more white privileges. No more police privileges.

Georgia is one of four states without a hate crime law. House Bill 426 relating to Hate Crimes has passed the Georgia House and is stalled in the State Senate. Specifically, if passed, the bill will enact “the Georgia Enhanced Penalties for Hate Crimes Act.” &nbsp;On February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Arbery was jogging through a neighborhood near his home in Brunswick, Georgia. At that time, George McMichael and Travis McMichael observed Arbery jogging and they confronted him with guns. &nbsp;However, when Arbery tried to defend himself from one of the gun wielding white men, he was savagely shot and killed by the man and his son.Please sign the attached petition. We will forward this petition, along with a letter of support to the bill's authors.Furthermore, call Governor Brian Kamp @ 404-656-1776 and Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan @ 404-656-5030 to voice your support for HB 426. </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5ee38bf3d6081e3e579ac98a_petitions_change.jpeg,change.org

If there isn’t a weapon found after someone has been shot (therefore, unarmed) by a police officer, then I propose that the officer should receive a mandatory 15-year prison sentence.We have seen over and over police officers get off, even with videotape footage of citizens having been shot by police officers. This is a new form of lynching. I am pleading with you to propose a bill that protects people who have every right to feel threatened by law enforcement. We always say we need more training for those involved in public safety, and there are increasing policies and laws that mandate that police officers have “body cameras” on them. Those measures do not address the whole problem, not when the individual officers who shoot unarmed victims aren’t punished.Senator, we are in a crisis where relationships between people of color and police officers are deteriorating, beyond the critical level. In order to build any sort of positive relationships again, we need laws to keep a balance in the lives of all the public. I might even suggest this as a title for this proposed legislation: the Hands UP ACT.I will be emailing this to the all of your colleagues in the U. S. Senate, members of Congress, State Governors; Democracy Now, the Huffington Post, ThinkProgress; and to other appropriate organizations across the country. Once this petition receives enough attention.

When it comes to discharging a gun, we need to shift from “reasonable” to “necessary;” Police officers should aim to disable or subdue, not kill. [EDIT: Some supporters of this petition have asked to include evaluations or screenings to reinforce these principles, which is a great idea- please leave a comment if you have suggestions on how to improve this bill.]We must change the way police officers think of using deadly force, and we must do so with the support of our federal government. The price of empathy-driven training is a fraction of the cost of settlement and, most importantly, human life. We must prevent history from repeating itself again.Nationwide riots and protests have captured national attention, but we must use that momentum to create lasting change through legislation. Once this petition gains 2,000 signatures, it will be presented to local members of Congress in hopes of introducing a bill calling for mandated police de-escalation training. Please take time to share this petition and contact your local government for support.

Numerous bystanders pleaded with the police officer to let him go, while Floyd said the words “I can’t breathe,” several times, but the officer refused to remove his knee from Floyd’s neck.On May 26th, officers Derek Chauvin and Tou Thao, and two other officers who were present, were fired from the Minneapolis Police Department. This is a step in the right direction to hold the officers accountable for murdering George Floyd but more action must be taken.

We have called on them to commit to the following by Saturday, May 30th at 8am:1. To never again vote to increase police funding or to increase the police department's budget. 2. To propose and vote for a $45 million cut from MPD's budget as the City responds to projected COVID-19 shortfalls. 3. To protect and expand current investment in community-led health and safety strategies, instead of investing in police.4. To do everything in my power to compel MPD and all law enforcement agencies to immediately cease enacting violence on community members. (Source: everyaction.com)Our city is on fire, our people are hurting, and Black communities are crying out for health and safety in the midst of pandemic. Now is the time to invest in a safe, liberated future for our city. We can't afford to keep funding MPD's attacks on Black lives.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5ee38d8c27a5c94f65b6a91e_petitions_everyaction.png,everydayaction.org

TPD, notorious for its racism, white supremacy, and transphobia has consistently misgendered Tony and refused to release the officer’s body camera footage and/or admit their wrongdoing in murdering and misgendering an unarmed black trans person.Many details surrounding this incident are unclear, but eyewitness accounts and video footage contradict the official TPD report which states that Mr. McDade was armed. In fact, video footage of the shooting shows that Tony was shot 5-8 times in the back and that the officer was standing over Tony when the last shot was fired. &nbsp;Please join us in demanding #JusticeForTony. </p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5ee38d629fc589784c617a32_petitions_actionnetwork.jpeg,actionnetwork.org
