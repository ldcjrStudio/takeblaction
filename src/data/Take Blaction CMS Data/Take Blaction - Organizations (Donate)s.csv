With more than 1.5 million members, nearly 300 staff attorneys, thousands of volunteer attorneys, and offices throughout the nation, the ACLU of today continues to fight government abuse and to vigorously defend individual freedoms including speech and religion, a woman’s right to choose, the right to due process, citizens’ rights to privacy and much more. The ACLU stands up for these rights even when the cause is unpopular, and sometimes when nobody else will. While not always in agreement with us on every issue, Americans have come to count on the ACLU for its unyielding dedication to principle. The ACLU has become so ingrained in American society that it is hard to imagine an America without it.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5ee58ac318269a483d3e8457_ACLU.jpg,Donate

It is one part of a multi-racial, cross-class movement centering the leadership of people of color.Therefore, SURJ believes in resourcing organizing led by people of color, and maintaining strong accountability relationships with organizers and communities of color as central part of our theory of change.SURJ believes that we must ground our organizing in a framework of “mutual interest” -- white supremacy is integral to economic injustice, to maintaining patriarchy and other forms of oppression. Racism and white supremacy keep the many divided for the benefit of the few. We must have an inclusive, open-hearted approach to organizing, calling people into this work rather than creating barriers to participation while maintaining a clear political line. When those of us who are white realize that racial justice is core to our liberation as well, then masses of white people will withdraw support from white supremacy. Together, as part of a powerful multi-racial, cross-class movement for collective liberation we can force the system of white supremacy to crumble.</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5edfdc4615dbd34ff38974f4/5ee580361829abe9b344f043_Showing%20up%20for%20racial%20justice.jpg,Donate
